# Research Focus

My primary interests are in [artificial intelligence augmentation](https://distill.pub/2017/aia/) (AIA) - the use of AI systems to help develop new methods for intelligence augmentation. In particular, I want to explore how AI will expand human thought and change our way of reasoning about the world.

Currently, I’m focusing on the following questions:

1. Are there non-monotonous abstract forms of human thinking that can be quantized and replaced by artificial intelligence (E.g., Willpower)?
2. In what ways can AI enhance and refine human communication and expression?
   1. Within the same language, can LLMs be used to help us better understand each other so less gets “lost in translation”?
   2. Will LLMs allow us to articulate our inner thoughts, feelings, and beliefs in more nuanced and efficient ways?
